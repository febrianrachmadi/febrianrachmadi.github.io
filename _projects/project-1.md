excerpt: "This is an ongoing (PhD) project to develop deep neural network models for predicting and delineating white matter hyperintensities (WMH) evolution in T2-FLAIR brain MRI. <br/><img src='/images/dep-gans-2critics-schematic.png'>"

Multiple recent studies have shown that WMH on a patient may decrease (i.e., shrink/regress), stay the same (i.e., stable), or increase (i.e., grow/progress) over a period of time. In this project, we refer to theses changes as evolution of WMH and propose deep neural network models to predict and delineate the evolution of WMH automatically. In this porject, we primarily used irregularity map (IM) and generative adversarial network (GAN) for our proposed Disease Evolution Predictor (DEP) model.
