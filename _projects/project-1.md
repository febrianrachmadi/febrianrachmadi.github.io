Multiple recent studies have shown that WMH on a patient may decrease (i.e., shrink/regress), stay the same (i.e., stable), or increase (i.e., grow/progress) over a period of time. In this project, we refer to theses changes as evolution of WMH and propose deep neural network models to predict and delineate the evolution of WMH automatically.
