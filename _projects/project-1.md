title: "Automatic Prediction and Delineation of White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) Evolution (i.e., Progression and Regression) in Brain MRI using Deep Neural Networks"
excerpt: "Multiple recent studies have shown that WMH on a patient may decrease (i.e., shrink/regress), stay the same (i.e., stable), or increase (i.e., grow/progress) over a period of time. In this project, we refer to theses changes as evolution of WMH and propose deep neural network models to predict and delineate the evolution of WMH automatically.<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"

This is an ongoing (PhD) project to develop deep neural network models for predicting and delineating WMH evolution in T2-FLAIR brain MRI.
