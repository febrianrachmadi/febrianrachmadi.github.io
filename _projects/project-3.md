In this project, we explored various machine learning algorithms to perform white matter hyperintensities (WMH) segmentation in brain MRI. From this project, we could observe how well deep neural networks for WMH segmentation compared to more conventional machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF).
