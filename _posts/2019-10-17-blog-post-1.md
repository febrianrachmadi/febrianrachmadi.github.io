In MICCAI 2019 in Shenzhen, there is a lot of interesting papers about predicting the progression of disease. Because they are related to my current work, I am going to (short)list these kind of papers in this blog post. Furthermore, I will try to categorising these papers based on their approaches of predicting the progression of disease. Feel free to contact me if I missed similar MICCAI 2019 papers about prediction of disease's progression! 

Note: This post will be be updated as soon as I find more relevant papers in MICCAI 2019.

## Predicting the progression of disease-specific lesions/regions

The following papers proposed predictive models to predict the progression (and regression) of disease-specific lesions/regions.
