I am currently working as a postdoctoral research scientist at [Brain Image Analysis (BIA) Unit](http://bia.riken.jp/), [RIKEN Center of Brain Science (RIKEN CBS)](https://cbs.riken.jp/en/), Wako, Japan. I am now directly supervised by Dr. Henrik Skibbe, the team leader of BIA Unit to develop machine/deep learning techniques for processing and analyzing marmoset brain image data. My main area of interest is medical image analysis and computation using data-driven methods, such as deep learning algorithms. 

I did my PhD and MSc studies at the [School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics), supervised by [Prof. Taku Komura](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/tkomura/) and co-supervised by [Dr. Maria Valdés Hernández](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/maria-valdes-hernandez(f22f22d9-52bb-4883-bf94-52aa23a691e1).html). At that time, I was affiliated with the [Computer Graphics and Visualisation (CGVU)](http://www.ipab.inf.ed.ac.uk/cgvu/index.html) research group in the [Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour (IPAB)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ipab) (School of Informatics) and [Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences (CCBS)](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences). My PhD thesis is titled **"Development of machine learning schemes for segmentation, characterisation, and evolution prediciton of white matter hyperintensities in structural brain MRI"** and examined by [Prof. Emanuale Trucco](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AoqaZGkAAAAJ&hl=en) from the University of Dundee (external examiner) and [Dr. Mohsen Khadem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=EdlB5Q8AAAAJ) from the University of Edinburgh (internal examiner).

Previously, I worked closely with [Prof. Wisnu Jatmiko](http://staff.ui.ac.id/wisnuj) at the [Faculty of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ui.ac.id/?lang=en), Universitas Indonesia. Some of my previous works are automatic vehicle counting system for intelligent traffic system, automatic peer assessment rating (PAR) index calculation on dental image. Please see list of my [reserach/project](https://febrianrachmadi.github.io/projects/) and [publications](https://febrianrachmadi.github.io/publications/) in the corresponding pages.
