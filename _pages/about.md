I am a fourth-year PhD student in Informatics at [School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics), advised by [Dr. Taku Komura](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/tkomura/) and [Dr. Maria Valdes Hernandez](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/maria-valdes-hernandez(f22f22d9-52bb-4883-bf94-52aa23a691e1).html). Within the University of Edinburgh, I am affiliated with [Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour (IPAB)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ipab)'s [Computer Graphics and Visualisation (CGVU)](http://www.ipab.inf.ed.ac.uk/cgvu/index.html) research group at School of Informatics and [Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences (CCBS)](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences).

My main area of interest is computer vision using machine learning in medical imaging field. My current (PhD) project is developong a predictive mmodel to automatically predict and delineate the evolution (i.e., progression and regression) of White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) of Alzherimer's Disease in T2-FLAIR of brain MRI.
