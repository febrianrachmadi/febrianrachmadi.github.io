I am a fourth-year PhD student in Informatics at [School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics), advised by [Dr. Taku Komura](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/tkomura/) and [Dr Maria Valdes Hernandez](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/maria-valdes-hernandez(f22f22d9-52bb-4883-bf94-52aa23a691e1).html). Within the University of Edinburgh, I am affiliated with [Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour (IPAB)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ipab) at the School of Informatics and [Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences (CCBS)](https://www.ed.ac.uk/clinical-brain-sciences).

My main interest is computer vision using machine learning in medical imaging. My current project is developong a predictive modelling to automatically predict and delineate the progression/regression (i.e., evolution) of White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) of Alzherimer's Disease.
